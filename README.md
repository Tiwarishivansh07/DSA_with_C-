# DSA_with_C++
This repository contains implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ for learning and practice.
C++ Basics :-
    -> Variables, Data Types, and Operators
    -> Control Structures (if, for, while, switch)
    -> Functions and Recursion
    -> Pointers and References
    -> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    -> File Handling
Data Structures :-
    -> Arrays
    <!-- -> Linked List  -->
    <!-- -> Stack -->
    <!-- -> Queue -->
    <!-- -> Trees  -->
    <!-- -> Graphs -->
    <!-- -> Hashing  -->
    <!-- -> Heap -->

Algorithms :-
    -> Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.)
    -> Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search)
    <!-- -> Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Fibonacci, etc.) -->
    <!-- -> Greedy Algorithms (Huffman Coding, etc.) -->
    <!-- -> Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS, DFS) -->

How to Run :-
    (1) Clone the repository:
           git clone https://github.com/Tiwarishivansh07/dsa-in-cpp.git

    (2) Compile and run the C++ files:
           g++ filename.cpp -o output
